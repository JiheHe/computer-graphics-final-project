# computer-graphics-final-project

Welcome to our game! Here's the isntruction on how the game works:

Press "Start Game" to start the game in the current level
Feel free to pause and resume/restart the level at any time by pressing "Pause"
Use a mouse to rotate, zoom, and pan the orbital camera around the scene. 
Use WASD to move the static character. W always move the character away from your camera, S ... closer to..., A ... left of ..., and D ... right of
Press "space" key on your keyboard to JUMP.

Goal:
The scene is getting flooded and the tsunami is causing a wreckage on the surface. Buildings are crumbling and breaking into pieces... Try to survive!
(Basic idea: water level will rise and water particles will be hitting you. Try your best to climb the buildings and survive before the 
time runs out.）

You will die if the water goes above your head... you'll drown.
You can jump on broken building pieces... if you have fast hands to save yourself...

Try to finish the game with as much health as possible! There isn't a scoring system yet, but just for fun ：3

Currently only 1 level is available, but behind the game many versatile scene-setup-and-transition strutures are implemented. So it's easy to set up new levels. 

Have fun!
